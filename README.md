# Password Generator
​
## Description 
​​
I was given the assignment of creating a password generator that would let a user pick the length of the password and whether or not they would want certain characters. The challenge provided the html and css, while I had to show of what I've learned from my lessons about JavaScript.

First, I structured the directories to fit best practices and rewrote the html just a little bit to accomodate this organization. 

In order to accomplish the requirments of the challenge, I had to head to the JavaScript source page and write several prompts and alerts that would fulfill the acceptance criteria. Second, I had to write a for loop incorporating the JavaScript Math object that would write a random password from the arrays that I created using the user's preferences, and store the result in an array. Finally I had to join that array as a string and name it so it would appear in the box for the User. Voila! You've got yourself a password!

## Installation
​
My password Generator is deployed from my GitHub Repo https://github.com/Clayto30/friendly-parakeet

Feel free to head to my website and check it out! Simply answer the prompts, and you will get a password of your desired styling.

​
## Usage 
​
When you visit my page, click on the button that says "Generate Password" to get started.
You will be asked how many characters long you would like it to be. Feel free to choose a password that is shorter or longer, and you will see I keep you on course! Now, choose on within the limits to proceed!

Please click "OK" when appropriate to select upper case characters, lower case characters, special characters, and/or numerals. Your password will be made up of a random assortment of whichever groups you choose.
